## Why does this exist?

If you‚Äôre like me and genuinely *enjoy* using Windows, because what‚Äôs life as a web developer without a few extra challenges, then this setup is for you!  
Sometimes we pick Windows for the fun of it, the thrill of a fresh update, or just because we love a good plot twist in our workflow.

But why settle for the default terminal vibes when you can make your PowerShell look and feel (almost) as cool as a Linux shell? With this repo, you get a terminal that‚Äôs actually fun to use. Let‚Äôs embrace Windows and make the best of it, one prompt at a time.

## Features

- ‚ú® **Oh My Posh** for a customizable, eye-catching prompt (if you‚Äôre staring at a terminal, it should spark joy)
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Linux-style key bindings** so your muscle memory survives the jump between platforms
- üõ†Ô∏è Modular config so you can add hacks and tweaks as you wish
- üñ•Ô∏è Productivity boosts that‚Äôll have you wondering, ‚ÄúIs this really PowerShell?!‚Äù

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository (downloading zip files is so last decade):**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   ```
   
2. **Copy the profile to your PowerShell profile location:**
   (Or symlink it if you like to live dangerously.)
   ```powershell
    # Example: Copying from repo's src/ folder
    cp ./src/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 $PROFILE
    ```
   
3. **Install the prerequisites:**
    - [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5) (of course, manually installing the latest version)
      - `winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget`
    - [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows/) (your prompt deserves a glow up)
      - `winget install JanDeDobbeleer.OhMyPosh -s winget`

4. **Pick a theme:**
   Use your favorite `.omp.json` or grab mine (`zash.omp.json`). Toss it in your themes folder and point your profile to it. (Make it yours!)
